# Attack-XGNN
This repository contains the official version of source code on the paper "Graph Neural Network Explanations are Fragile"(https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03193).

Here we post the code on attacking PG-Explainer first, while the code for GNNEX and GSAT is currently being organized and will be post in very soon.
